## FIzzBuzz solution in Test Driven Design approach in C#

This project applies TDD using C# to solve a FIZZBUZZ challenge.
This is part of my learning on how to write tests for C# projects, 
in this case I used [XUnit](https://xunit.net/) tests framework and [FLuentAssertions](https://fluentassertions.com/) library for creating test scenarios

### Write Test, Code, then Refactor/think about design

This is not a Console application hence doesn't have a Main()
You can only run the tests using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) from Jetbrains for Mac
